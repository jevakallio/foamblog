# Foam

Eventually, this will become a public blog, but for now I'm testing Foam's features for blogging/static site generation. Nothing to see here, come back later.

- [[todo]]
- [[testing-wiki-links]]
- [[secondary-file]]
- [[inbox]]
- [[new-file-md]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[todo]: todo.md "Todo"
[testing-wiki-links]: testing-wiki-links.md "Testing wiki links 3"
[secondary-file]: secondary-file.md "Secondary file"
[inbox]: inbox.md "inbox"
[new-file-md]: new-file-md.md "new-file.md"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
